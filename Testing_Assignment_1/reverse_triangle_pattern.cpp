//Description: This C++ code prints a reverse triangle pattern using asterisks (*) on the console. 
//The pattern starts with ten asterisks on the first line and removes one asterisk from each subsequent 
//line until it reaches one asterisk on the last line. The output will look like an upside-down 
//right-angled triangle.
