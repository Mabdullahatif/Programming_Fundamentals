//Description: This C++ code prints a right-aligned triangle pattern using asterisks (*) on the console. 
//The pattern starts with ten asterisks on the first line and adds one space before each subsequent line, 
//creating a right-aligned triangle. The output will look like a right-angled triangle that is aligned 
//to the right.
